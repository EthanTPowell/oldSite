        Marshall D. Teach is shrouded in mystery. He appeared one day and joined
        the Whitebeard Pirates for years until they encountered the dark dark
        fruit. This fruit turns the user into pure darkness and also has other
        abilities that are unknown to all but a select few. At that point, he
        killed the person who found it and defected with the fruit. he was
        pursued by Fire Fist Ace, but the power of Teach's fruit overwhelmed Ace
        and he captured Ace instead. At which point, he turned Ace in to the
        World Government in order to garner favor and join the ranks of the
        seven warlords of the sea, the select group of pirates with immunity
        backed by the government. His real goal was to gain their trust in order
        to free criminals from the prison Impel Down to form his crew while
        Whitebeard attacked the world government in order to rescue Ace. When
        whitebeard attacked, Blackbeard waited until he was weakened and somehow
        used the dark fruit to steal the powers of Whitebeard's Tremor fruit,
        said to be one of the most powerful fruits in the world, from him. After
        the battle, Blackbeard was declared as an emperor of the sea in
        Whitebeard's place and is now feared by all.
