      <h2>War at Marineford</h2>
      <p>
        Earlier this week, the whitebeard pirates invaded the marine HQ in an
        effort to free their captured member Portgas D. Ace. Ace, being the head
        of one of Whitebeard's divisions, was sentenced to execution. That was
        when the pirates invaded. It became an all out war between all the
        military might of the world government and the might of Whitebeards's
        fleet. At the same time, Strawhat Luffy and Marshall D. Teach had
        separately staged prison breaks in Impel Down, the highest security
        prison in the world. Straw Hat then arrived at Marineford with the
        intent to help save Ace, but Teach showed up with a group of escaped
        convicts from Impel Down and interrupted the fight, killing whitebeard
        and taking the power of the tremor tremor fruit from him. At the same
        time, Luffy was attempting to escape with Ace when the ever-reliable
        Admiral Akainu carried out the execution himself and seemingly mortally
        wounded Straw Hat, but Red Hair shanks appeared and declared that the
        fighting would either stop there or he would involve himself. The world
        government, having already accomplished the gargantuan task of defeating
        an emperor, agreed to end the fighting there.
        <br />
        Just days later, Straw Hat Luffy infiltrated Marineford by himself to
        ring the Ox bell which, given its normal usage of ushering in the new
        year, seemed to be Straw Hat declaring the beginning of a new era.
