        Shanks is originally from the West Blue. He traveled with Gold Roger and
        his crew for years as an apprentice during Roger's travels when he was
        young. After Roger's execution, Shanks formed his own pirate crew and
        set out on the seas. He is now one of the four emperors who rule the new
        world, and is the one second most shrouded in mystery. Red hair has no
        devil's fruit abilities. He instead uses his immense haki and strength
        to take down his opponents. Compared to the rest of the emperors, he may
        at first look like a normal person, but this man could clash evenly with
        Whitebeard, who was once deemed the strongest man in the world. The Red
        Hair pirates also have complete control over the sake trade in and out
        of East Blue. It is reported that Red Hair passed the Straw hat that
        Monkey D. Luffy wears on to him after Red Hair had originally gotten it
        from the Pirate King, Gold Roger.
