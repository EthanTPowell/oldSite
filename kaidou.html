        While Whitebeard was known as the strongest man alive, Kaidou is feared
        all around the world as the Strongest Creature alive. His strength is
        inhuman which is fitting as he leads the infamous crew that is the
        beaast pirates. His crew is chock full of zoan devil fruit users. This
        is because he arranged for Caesar Clown and Doflamingo to create
        artificial zoan devil fruits for his crew. His fruit transforms him into
        an Azure Dragon that can breathe fire and create fire clouds that he can
        use to fly or float entire islands miles in the air. Kaidou is also a
        master of all forms of haki, just like the rest of the emperors. His
        primary form of attack in his humanoid form is with his thunder Bagua
        which is essentially a massive spiked metal club that he imbues with
        immense amounts of armament haki. He sailed with the Rocks Pirates
        alongside Charlotte Linlin for years before founding the Beast Pirates.
