        Monkey D. Luffy is the rising star of the pirate world. He took to the
        seas three years ago to become the pirate king. He has gathered a crew
        of ten people who are all highly specialized in their fields of
        expertise. He has become the hope of many by taking territory from other
        pirate crews and challenging powerful pirates all through the grand
        line. Luffy at one point ate the rubber fruit and turned into a rubber
        human with the ability to stretch his body in all sorts of creative ways
        which he uses to come up with many varied and creative attacks. He also
        uses his rubber body to increase his blood flow and multiply his speed
        as well as inflate his bones to massively increase his destructive
        power. He also has mastered armament, observation, and conqueror's haki.
