        Big Mom grew up in a world renowned orphanage, but what the world didn't
        know was the Orphanage's connectino to the criminal underworld and the
        truth of what went on behind those doors. When she was at the orphanage,
        she was spoiled because of her giant heritage that would make her
        extremely valuable. However, she struggled with mental illness and a
        deep insatiable hunger. This hunger eventually led her to snap and start
        eating everything. Food, the plates, the table, and eventually Carmel
        who led the orphanage and, at the time, had the soul fruit. Linlin
        eating Carmel transferred the power of the soul fruit to Linlin who then
        left and eventually joined the legendary rocks pirates with Kaidou. She
        sailed with Rocks for years before the crew disbanded and she created
        her own crew and started her journey to find the One Piece.
